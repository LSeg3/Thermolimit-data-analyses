This repository contains all the code written for the data wrangling, visualization and analysis regarding the respirometry trials performed for my paper and first dissertation chapter.

The scripts used in this project are listed below:

1. Temperature analyses: Used for obtaining the temperatures required to estimating oxygen consumed in the respirometry trials, as well as estimating the heat rigor.

2. Oxygen estimation: In which the temperature data from the prior script is used to estimate the rate of oxygen consumed by each individual during the thermolimit respirometry experiment, and then estimates the physiological estimates relevant (Rate optima, thermal optima, activation energy).

3. Thermolimit statistical analyses

4. Environment vs Performance:



The the data and scripts here were collected, compiled and written by L. Segura Hernandez.
